# game_RPG1
RPG type game project to play around and test some concepts.
This is going to be one of my first steps as a game developer.
It's going to be a hobby for now but in the future who knows.
I hope to learn a whole bunch of new stuff, including some c#,
scripting, modeling, animations, level and character design, etc.
